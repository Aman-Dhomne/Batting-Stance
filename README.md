# Real-Time Batting Stance Correction with Python

This Python program utilizes OpenCV, Mediapipe, NumPy, and scikit-learn libraries to provide real-time feedback on batting stance based on video input from the user's webcam. It analyzes the user's batting stance and suggests corrections, such as lowering or raising the bat, to improve batting technique.

## Features

- Real-time feedback on batting stance using webcam input
- Analyzes batting stance and suggests corrections
- Utilizes OpenCV, Mediapipe, NumPy, and scikit-learn for video processing and analysis

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. The program will use your webcam to capture video input in real-time.
3. Based on your batting stance, the program will suggest corrections, such as lowering or raising the bat.
